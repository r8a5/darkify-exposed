*Exposing the truth behind the AI-generated tool sold by Darkify*

---

## ðŸ§  What Is This?

This repository contains the **leaked source code** of a tool called **Partner Go**, sold by [Darkify](https://discord.gg/darkifyteam).  
After using the product and experiencing repeated issues, I inspected the files myself â€” and what I discovered raises serious red flags.

---

## ðŸ§¾ What I Found

While monitoring my temp folder, I came across two suspicious files:

- **`Hellion.exe`** â€“ A known Remote Access Tool (RAT) also sold by Darkify.
- **`auto-partner.py`** â€“ The core script behind their Partner Go tool.

---

## ðŸ¤– It's Clearly AI-Generated

Opening `auto-partner.py` made it obvious:  
The code was generated by AI. It had:
- An excessive amount of random `#` comments
- Poor structure and logic
- No real signs of human review or quality assurance

When I asked them about it, they kept **denying everything**, despite how obvious it was.

---

## ðŸ’¬ Their Attitude

Instead of owning up to it or addressing the concerns, the developers were:
- **Rude**
- **Dismissive**
- And completely **uninterested in user feedback**

They clearly donâ€™t care about the quality of what theyâ€™re selling â€” only how much money they can make from it.

---

## ðŸ’¸ All About Profit

Darkify is a large server with thousands of members, yet theyâ€™re:

- Selling **low-effort tools**
- **Lying** about how they're made
- Prioritizing **revenue over reputation**

> It's not about whether AI is used. It's about being honest, transparent, and delivering value â€” not just cashing out on hype.

## ðŸš« Final Message

> Selling AI-generated code isnâ€™t the problem.  
> **Lying, being rude to your users, and caring only about profit is.**

This leak exists to protect others from wasting their time, money, and trust on developers who put greed before integrity.

---

> ðŸ’¥ **Donâ€™t support creators who donâ€™t respect their community.**
